The statistical test that you choose is appropriate "two tails dependent t-test".
Please expand the answer to justify also the reason for using the t-test in this
 case. The justification should consider the small sample size ( smaller than 30)
  and the sample distribution (can we assume the sample is normal? ).

A hypothesis test is a statistical test that is used to determine whether there
 is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true
  for the entire population.

Usually the null hypothesis is a statement of "no effect" or "no difference".
The alternative hypothesis is the statement you want to be able to conclude is true.

significance level 0.05


    Ho: μ = μ0
    H1: μ < μ0 (a lower-tailed test) or
    H1: μ > μ0 (a upper-tailed test) or
    H1: μ ≠ μ0 (a two-tailed test)
